# Vehicular_Monitoring
The project detects License plate and helmet from the image and gives the output. 
It also stores the license plate number along with the timestamp in the database. 
This software might give you an error since it is under construction.
Do make a OUTPUT folder under the same repository as the helmet output are stored in this folder.
